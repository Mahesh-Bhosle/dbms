EMPLOYEE (SSN, Name, Address, Sex, Salary, DNo)
DEPARTMENT (DNo, DName, MgrSSN, MgrStartDate) 
DLOCATION (DNo,DLoc) 
PROJECT (PNo, PName, PLocation, DNo) 
WORKS_ON (SSN, PNo, Hours)

1. Display the employee details whose salary is greater than 5 lakh , sorting the 
records in descending order of SSN.
Select * from Employee where salary > 500000 order by SSN DESC;

2. Display the number of employees along with project name working on each 
project.
SELECT count(*), P.Pname FROM
EMPLOYEE E, WORKS_ON W, PROJECT P
WHERE E.SSN=W.SSN
AND W.PNO=P.PNO
group by Pname;

3. Show the resulting salaries if every employee working on the ‘IOT’ project is given 
a10 percent raise.
SELECT E.FNAME, E.LNAME, 1.1*E.SALARY AS INCR_SAL FROM
EMPLOYEE E, WORKS_ON W, PROJECT P
WHERE E.SSN=W.SSN
AND W.PNO=P.PNO
AND P.PNAME='IOT';

4. Find the sum of the salaries of all employees of the ‘Dept2’ department, as well as 
the maximum salary, the minimum salary, and the average salary in this 
department
SELECT SUM(E.SALARY), MAX(E.SALARY), MIN(E.SALARY), 
AVG(E.SALARY)
FROM EMPLOYEE E, DEPARTMENT D
WHERE E.DNO=D.DNO
AND D.DNAME='Dept2';

5. For each department that has more than two employees, retrieve the department 
number and the number of its employees who are making more than Rs. 6,00,000.
SELECT D.DNO, COUNT(*)
FROM DEPARTMENT D, EMPLOYEE E
WHERE D.DNO=E.DNO
AND E.SALARY>600000
AND D.DNO IN (SELECT E1.DNO
FROM EMPLOYEE E1 GROUP
BY E1.DNO HAVING COUNT(*)>2)
GROUP BY D.DNO
