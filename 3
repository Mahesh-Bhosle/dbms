3. The following relations keep track of airline flight information: 
Flights (flight_no: integer, frm: string, to: string, distance: integer, departs: time, arrives: 
time, price: integer)
Aircraft (aircraft_id: integer, aircraft_name: string, cruisingrange: integer) 
Certified (eid: integer, aircraft_id: integer) 
Employees (eid: integer, ename: string, salary: integer)

1.Find the names of aircraft such that all pilots certified to operate them have salaries 
more than Rs 80,000.
SELECT DISTINCT a.aircraft_name
 FROM aircraft a,certified c,employees e
 WHERE a.aircraft_id=c.aircraft_id
 AND c.eid=e.eid
 AND NOT EXISTS
 (SELECT *
 FROM employees e1
 WHERE e1.eid=e.eid
 AND e1.salary<80000);
 
 2. For each pilot who is certified for more than three aircrafts, find the eid 
and the maximum cruising range of the aircraft for which he/she is certified.
SELECT c.eid,MAX(cruisingrange)
FROM certified c,aircraft a
 WHERE c.aircraft_id=a.aircraft_id
 GROUP BY c.eid
 HAVING COUNT(*)>3;
 
 3. For all aircrafts with cruisingrange over 1000 kms,find the name of the aircraft and 
the average salary of all pilots certified for this aircraft.
SELECT a.aircraft_id,a.aircraft_name,AVG(e.salary)
 FROM aircraft a,certified c,employees e
 WHERE a.aircraft_id=c.aircraft_id
 AND c.eid=e.eid
 AND a.cruisingrange>1000
 GROUP BY a.aircraft_id,a.aircraft_name;

4. Find the names of pilots certified for some Boeing aircraft.
SELECT distinct e.ename
 FROM employees e,aircraft a,certified c
WHERE e.eid=c.eid
 AND c.aircraft_id=a.aircraft_id
 AND a.aircraft_name='Boeing';

5. Find the aircraft_id's of all aircraft that can be used on routes from Bangalore to 
Delhi.
SELECT a.aircraft_id
 FROM aircraft a
 WHERE a.cruisingrange>
 (SELECT MIN(f.distance)
 FROM flight f
 WHERE f.frm='Bangalore'
 AND f.too='Delhi')
